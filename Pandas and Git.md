## Pandas 🐼

### 1. What is Pandas?

Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets, you should know this by now. It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data. The name "Pandas" has a reference to both "Panel Data", and "Python Data Analysis" and was created by Wes McKinney in 2008.

Speaking of *analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating* data, what functions can you use for each of these tasks? 🤔:
- **A**nalyze data?
- **C**lean data?
- **E**xplore data?
- **M**anipulate data?

**Fill the table below:**
  

function | what it does | category
------------ | ----------- | ---------
`astype()` |   |  
`groupby()` |   |  
`sort_values()` |   |  
`pivot_table()` |   |  
`merge()` |   |  
`plot()` |   |  
`corr()` |   |  
`cov()` |   |  
`apply()` |   |  
`loc()` |   |  
`iloc()` |   |  
`iterrows()` |   |  
`aggregate()` |   |

### 2. Pandas and NumPy 🔢 [BONUS 🎁](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1068680/)

Pandas is built on top of the NumPy package, which means that many of the methods in NumPy are also available in Pandas. Data in pandas is often used to feed statistical analysis in SciPy, plotting functions from Matplotlib, and machine learning algorithms in Scikit-learn.

Speaking of NumPy, here are questions about it:

- What is the output of the following code? And why is it so?

``` python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])
c = np.vstack((a, b))

print(c[1][2])
```
```
output: 6
why: because of [1] is second row, and [2] is third column where zero index.
```


- What is the output of the following code? And why is it so?

``` python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])
c = np.intersect1d(a, b)

print(c)
```
```
output: []
why: because intersect1d function returns the sorted, unique values that are in both of the input arrays, and there are no common numberes.
```

  
- What is the output of the following code? And why is it so?

``` python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])
c = np.setdiff1d(a, b)

print(c)
```
```
output: [1 2 3]
why: because setdiff1d function returns the sorted, unique values that are in the first input array but not in the second input array.
```

- Which of the following is a function in NumPy used for carrying out Einstein summations?

    - [ ]  `np.tensordot()`
    - [ ]  `np.dot()`
    - [x]  `np.einsum()`
    - [ ]  `np.outer()`

- The `np.outer` function is primarily intended for:

    - [ ]  Computing the tensor dot product of two arrays.
    - [X]  Computing the outer product of two arrays.
    - [ ]  Computing the inner product of two arrays.
    - [ ]  Computing the cross product of two arrays.


### 3. Pandas and Matplotlib 📈
Pandas can be used to visualize data using a wrapper for `matplotlib.pyplot.plot()`. You can plot data directly from your DataFrame using certain functions.

- What functions can you use to plot data directly from your DataFrame? 🤔
  ```
  there are several function that allow to plot directory from data frame such as:
  
    1. DataFrame.plot(): This function is a wrapper around matplotlib.pyplot.plot() and allows you to create various types of plots, such as line plots, bar            plots, scatter plots, etc.
    2. DataFrame.plot.line(): This function is used for creating line plots from a DataFrame.
    3. DataFrame.plot.bar(): This function is used for creating bar plots from a DataFrame.
    4. DataFrame.plot.scatter(): This function is used for creating scatter plots from a DataFrame.
  ```

- What is the output of the following code? And why is it so?
  ```
  -The code you provided creates a Pandas DataFrame df with dimensions 10x4, filled with random numbers generated from a standard normal distribution using 
   np.random.randn(). The DataFrame has column names 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'.

  -Then, it plots a scatter plot using df.plot.scatter() with the 'a' column values as the x-axis and the 'b' column values as the y-axis.
  ```

``` python
df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(10, 4), columns=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'])
df.plot.scatter(x='a', y='b')
```
- What do you know about `np.random.randn()`? And how does it depend on `np.random.seed()`?
  ```
  -`np.random.randn()`: is a NumPy function that generates an array of random numbers from a standard normal distribution (mean 0, standard deviation 1).
  -`np.random.seed()`: is used to set the seed value for the random number generator in NumPy. you can ensure that the random numbers generated by NumPy are     
    reproducible, meaning that executing the same code with the same seed will produce the same random numbers.
  ```

## Problem Solving 🤔
[A. Panoramix's Prediction](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/80/A)
```
  n, m = map(int, input().split())
  prime_nums = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47]
  
  x = prime_nums.index(n)
   
  if x < 14 and m == prime_nums[x+1]:
      print("YES")
  else:
      print("NO")
