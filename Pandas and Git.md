## Pandas üêº

### 1. What is Pandas?

Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets, you should know this by now. It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data. The name "Pandas" has a reference to both "Panel Data", and "Python Data Analysis" and was created by Wes McKinney in 2008.

Speaking of *analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating* data, what functions can you use for each of these tasks? ü§î:
- **A**nalyze data?
- **C**lean data?
- **E**xplore data?
- **M**anipulate data?

**Fill the table below:**
  

function | what it does | category
------------ | ----------- | ---------
`astype()` | Change the data type of an object | ¬†**C**lean data
`groupby()` | Split the dataframe into groups¬† | ¬†**M**anipulate data
`sort_values()` | Sort a data frame¬† | ¬†**M**anipulate data
`pivot_table()` | Creates a MultiIndex dataframe ¬† | ¬†**A**nalyze data
`merge()` | Merge DataFrames¬†or Series together | ¬†**M**anipulate data
`plot()` | Make a desired plot of the DataFrame¬† | ¬†**A**nalyze data
`corr()` | Compute the correlation(measure the strength and direction of a linear relationship) between columns¬† | ¬†**A**nalyze data
`cov()` | Compute the covariance(measure only the direction of a linear relationship) between columns¬† | ¬†**A**nalyze data¬† | ¬†**A**nalyze data
`apply()` | Apply a function to a DataFrame or a series object¬† | ¬†**A**nalyze data
`loc()` | Access rows by labels¬† | ¬†**E**xplore data
`iloc()` | Access rows by index¬† | ¬†**E**xplore data
`iterrows()` | ¬†Iterate over DataFrame rows | ¬†**E**xplore data
`aggregate()` | Apply a function or list of functions to a DataFrame¬† | **A**nalyze data

### 2. Pandas and NumPy üî¢ [BONUS üéÅ](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1068680/)

Pandas is built on top of the NumPy package, which means that many of the methods in NumPy are also available in Pandas. Data in pandas is often used to feed statistical analysis in SciPy, plotting functions from Matplotlib, and machine learning algorithms in Scikit-learn.

Speaking of NumPy, here are questions about it:

- What is the output of the following code? And why is it so?

``` python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])
c = np.vstack((a, b))

print(c[1][2])
```
>6


- What is the output of the following code? And why is it so?

``` python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])
c = np.intersect1d(a, b)

print(c)
```

>[]

  
- What is the output of the following code? And why is it so?

``` python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])
c = np.setdiff1d(a, b)

print(c)
```

>[1, 2, 3]

- Which of the following is a function in NumPy used for carrying out Einstein summations?

    - [ ]  `np.tensordot()`
    - [ ] ¬†`np.dot()`
    - [x] ¬†`np.einsum()`
    - [ ] ¬†`np.outer()`

- The `np.outer` function is primarily intended for:

    - [ ] ¬†Computing the tensor dot product of two arrays.
    - [x] ¬†Computing the outer product of two arrays.
    - [ ] ¬†Computing the inner product of two arrays.
    - [ ] ¬†Computing the cross product of two arrays.


### 3. Pandas and Matplotlib üìà
Pandas can be used to visualize data using a wrapper for `matplotlib.pyplot.plot()`. You can plot data directly from your DataFrame using certain functions.

- What functions can you use to plot data directly from your DataFrame? ü§î  
  - pd.df.plot.scatter()
  - pd.df.plot.line()
  - pd.df.plot.bar()
  - pd.df.plot.box()
  - pd.df.plot.kde()
  - pd.df.plot.hist()
  - pd.df.plot.pie()
  - pd.df.hist()
  - pd.df.boxplot()
  ----


- What is the output of the following code? And why is it so?  
``` python
df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(10, 4), columns=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'])
df.plot.scatter(x='a', y='b')
```
![Alt text](image.png)

>`np.random.randn(10, 4)` returns two dimentions array(10 rows, 4 columns) of random numbers

>`df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(10, 4), columns=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'])`   make a DataFrame of the array and define its columns

>`df.plot.scatter(x='a', y='b')` make a scatter plot, putting column(a) on x-axis and column(b) on y-axis  
    Every point represnts values for two different numeric values in a and b columns

----

- What do you know about `np.random.randn()`? And how does it depend on `np.random.seed()`?
 
    >`np.random.randn()` returns n-dims array of random numbers
    `np.random.seed()`  make the random function generate the same values over and over again
